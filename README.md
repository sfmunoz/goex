## Packages vs Modules

From [How to Write Go Code](https://go.dev/doc/code):

* **Package:**
  * Go programs are organized into packages.
  * A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together.
  * Functions, types, variables, and constants defined in one source file are visible to all other source files within the same package.
* **Module:**
  * A repository contains one or more modules.
  * A module is a collection of related Go packages that are released together.
  * A Go repository typically contains only one module, located at the root of the repository.
  * A file named go.mod there declares the module path: the import path prefix for all packages within the module

Adapted example from [Tutorial: Create a Go module](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module):

```
$ pwd
<HOME>/go/src/example.com

$ mkdir greetings

$ cd greetings

$ go mod init example.com/greetings
go: creating new go.mod: module example.com/greetings

$ ls
go.mod

$ cat go.mod
module example.com/greetings
go 1.21.2

$ vi greetings.go

$ cat greetings.go
package greetings
import "fmt"
func Hello(name string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hi, %v. Welcome!", name)
}

$ vi greetings_test.go 

$ cat greetings_test.go
package greetings
import (
    "fmt"
    "testing"
)
func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
    got := Hello("World")
    want := "Hi, World. Welcome!"
    if got != want {
        t.Errorf("got != want | '%s' != '%s'", got, want)
    }
    fmt.Printf("ok: got == want == '%s'\n", got)
}

$ go test
ok: got == want == 'Hi, World. Welcome!'
PASS
ok      example.com/greetings   0.002s
```

    - Does the method need to modify the receiver?
    - It will be much cheaper to use a pointer receiver.
    - If some of the methods of the type must have pointer receivers, the rest should too, so the method set is consistent regardless of how the type is used.
  - [Why do T and *T have different method sets?](https://go.dev/doc/faq#different_method_sets)
    - The method set of a type T consists of all methods with receiver type T
    - That of the corresponding pointer type *T consists of all methods with receiver *T or T.
    - That means the method set of *T includes that of T, but not the reverse.
